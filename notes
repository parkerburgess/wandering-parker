● [slug] is a Next.js dynamic route segment. The square brackets are Next.js file-system routing syntax — any URL matching
  /projects/<anything> will be handled by the files inside that folder.

  Here's what it does end to end:

  Routing
  - A URL like /projects/fly-fishing-tracker matches this route, and slug is set to "fly-fishing-tracker".
  - params.slug gives you that value inside the page.

  page.tsx
  1. generateStaticParams — tells Next.js which slugs exist at build time (one per project), so it can pre-render each project page      
  statically.
  2. generateMetadata — sets the <title> tag dynamically based on the matched project.
  3. ProjectPage — looks up the project by slug. If it doesn't exist, calls notFound() (returns a 404). Otherwise renders the project    
  name/description and passes the slug to ProjectLoader.

  ProjectLoader.tsx
  - Lazily imports projects/<slug>/component at runtime — meaning each project has its own React component file living at e.g.
  projects/fly-fishing-tracker/component.tsx.
  - Wraps it in <Suspense> so a "Loading…" fallback is shown while the component chunk is being fetched.

  In short: [slug] is the mechanism that lets one set of files serve every project page, routing /projects/X to the component found at   
  projects/X/component.tsx.
